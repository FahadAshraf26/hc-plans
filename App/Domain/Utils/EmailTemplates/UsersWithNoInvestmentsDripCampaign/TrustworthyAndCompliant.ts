        Hi {@USERNAME},
    </p>
    <br />
   <p>
        As an investment platform that lets YOU invest in small businesses with as little as $25, Honeycomb must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must also be a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) as a funding portal. This means Honeycomb has many compliance and security standards to meet.  
   </p>
   <p>
        Honeycomb was built as a platform where THE PEOPLE can easily fund small businesses. As such, we intend to be compliant with all regulatory bodies and will be as transparent as possible so every user, investor, and small business can continue to use Honeycomb to help build up the small business community in these tough times.  
   </p>
   <p>
        If you have any suggestions on how we can be more transparent, feel free to respond to this email. 
   </p>
   <p>
        Thank you for being a part of the Honeycomb Community and happy investing.
   </p>
   <br />
   <p>
        Best,
   </p>
