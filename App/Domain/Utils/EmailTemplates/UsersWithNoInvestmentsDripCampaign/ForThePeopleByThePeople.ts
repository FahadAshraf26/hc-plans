        Hi {@USERNAME},
    </p>
    <br />
   <p>
        Thanks for being a part of a community that invests in small businesses. We built Honeycomb because we believe that all capable small business owners deserve a chance to raise the capital they need to build and improve their business. By creating a mobile app where ANYONE can invest in a small business, we are putting the power of small business lending in YOUR hands, the PEOPLE. After checking out the campaign and all of its details, YOU can invest in a small business for as little as $100.   
   </p>
   <p>
        We believe when everyday people vote with their wallets about what types of businesses they want to see in their communities, more great people and ideas have an opportunity to flourish that otherwise might not exist. Diverse and thriving small businesses help strengthen local communities, and that’s our goal.
   </p>
   <p>
        We’re committed to ensuring opportunities on Honeycomb are easy to understand and inclusive. We expect you to hold us to that! Give us your feedback often so that together we can continue building a stronger economy that works for everyone.
   </p>
   <p>
        We are extremely proud of what our team has built and we’re excited to share it with you. Thank you for being a part of the Honeycomb community and we look forward to bringing you exciting and impactful small business investment opportunities for many years to come.
