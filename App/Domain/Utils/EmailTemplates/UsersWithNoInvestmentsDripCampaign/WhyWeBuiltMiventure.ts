        Hi {@USERNAME},

        Thanks for joining our small business investment community. We built Honeycomb because we believe communities are healthier when they’re financially empowered. On Honeycomb, ANYONE can easily invest in a small business and potentially earn passive income. We believe supporting entrepreneurship can contribute to positive outcomes, like job creation, that makes the community stronger.

        Getting started is easy:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete sign up</li>
            <li>Find a business you love</li>
            <li>Invest an amount you're comfortable with</li>
            <li>Relax and track your returns</li>

        </ul>
   </p>

       We’re committed to ensuring opportunities on Honeycomb are easy to understand. We expect you to hold us to that! Give us your feedback often so that together we can build an economy that works for everyone by keeping dollars in the community where they’ll make the most impact.
