    <h4 style='margin-bottom:0.65rem'>How does Honeycomb Work?</h4>
    Honeycomb Credit is a web-based platform that allows small businesses owners to borrow loans from their own
    customers and community. We recognized that many great local business owners struggle to get access to small 
    growth capital loans for their businesses while many individuals are looking for ways to invest locally in causes 
    and companies they believe in – Honeycomb connects these two groups through our platform to build 
    communities one small business at a time.    
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4 style='margin-bottom:0.65rem'>Is this like Kickstarter or GoFundMe?</h4>
    Not really. At Kickstarter or GoFundMe, you make donations to businesses and get nothing in return other than “rewards.” 
    – this is referred to as Reward Crowdfunding.  On our platform you are actually making a loan with the 
    expectation of getting your money back plus interest.</p>
    
    <p><b>If I invest in one of these businesses, do I become personally liable for anything?</b></p>
    <p>
    No, not at all. We choose our legal structures to protect investors from personal liability. If you choose to invest in 
    a campaign you are only liable to make the investment in the amount you designate.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4 style='margin-bottom:0.65rem'>Is the information I give you secure?</h4>
    Yes. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for security by making an encrypted link between your browser 
    and our associated servers. SSL is an industry standard for protecting the integrity of online 
    transactions. Under our Privacy Policy, we won’t sell or share your personal information with anyone.
    </p>
    <h4 style='margin-bottom:0.65rem'>Does Honeycomb pay promoters for marketing?</h4>
    No. Per Reg CF rules, if a Promoter does promote an offering, any 
    Promoter must clearly disclose in all communications on the Platform 
    that he or she is engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the 
    Issuer, and disclose the amount of compensation for his or her 
    promotional activities.
